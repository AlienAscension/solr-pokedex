\section*{Abstract}

This document provides a concise overview of the basic \LaTeX{} workflow, aimed at beginners who are new to the typesetting system.
It covers the fundamental steps of writing, compiling, and previewing a \LaTeX{} document.
The abstract outlines how users can create a \acrfull{mwe}, understand the compilation process (PDFLaTeX), and manage errors and outputs.
Emphasis is placed on practical tips and the logic behind \LaTeX's separation of content and style.
This serves as a foundation for further exploration into document classes, bibliography management, and advanced formatting.
